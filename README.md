# Speech-To-Text-Convert using Jupyter
This code will be able to convert the English audio file into text with proper punctuation. 
We used Assemblyai module for converting speech to text which easily does the job with punctuation marks into the text.
We also added an additional feature which enables to play sound using "winsound" built-in module.

#Packages used:
1)	Winsound
 In Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab, we can use the Winsound module to play simple sound alerts on Windows. The Winsound module provides a way to interact with the Windows Sound API.
2)	AssemblyAI
 AssemblyAI provides an API that can be used to transcribe speech to text. It offers automatic speech recognition (ASR) and transcription services.
3) Sounddevice
 The sounddevice module is a Python library that provides bindings for the PortAudio library, a cross-platform audio I/O library. This allows you to record and play audio from Python scripts easily.
4) Wavio
 The Wavio module is a Python library for reading and writing WAV files. It is a simple and easy-to-use module that can be used to load and save audio data and perform basic audio processing tasks.
