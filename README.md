# Speech-To-Text-Convert using Jupyter
This code will be able to convert the English audio file into text with proper punctuation. 
We used Assemblyai module for converting speech to text which easily does the job with punctuation marks into the text.
We also added an additional feature which enables to play sound using "winsound" built-in module.
